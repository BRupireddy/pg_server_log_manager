# pg_server_log_manager
A background worker to manage (compress, archive, delete) server logs generated by syslogger process. The manage algorithm gets triggered either based on time (every few hours) or based on total disk space occupied by all log files (say 1 GB). The background worker never lets the disk space of server log files grow. It first tries to compress all the log files and see if the disk space is more than the set limit, if yes, it archives the oldest files and deletes. This background workers needs syslogger process to be up and running, a good rotation scheme put in place, also it needs to know what the current syslogger file is.

NOTE: This module is under development.
